## redux store:

- One store for the entire application
- Responsibilities:

  - Holds application state
  - Allows access to state via getState()
  - Allows state to be updated via dispatch(action)
  - Registers listeners via subscribe(listener)
  - handles unregistering of listeners via the function returned by subscribe(listener)

- Redux pattern:
  - Create a store
  - Declare the initial state and the reducer
  - Define your action and action creators
  - Subscribe to the store
  - Dispatch actions to update the store
  - Finally unsubscribe to the changes

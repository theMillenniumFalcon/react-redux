# Three principles:

## First principle:

- The state of the application is stored in an object tree within a single store. --> Maintain our application is stored in an object tree within a single store.
- Cake shop -->
  Let's assume we are tracking the number of cakes on the shelf
  {
  numberOfCakes: 10
  }

## Second principle:

- The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.
- To update the state of your app, you need to let Redux know about that with an action, not allowed to directly update the state object.
- Cake shop -->
  Let the shopkeeper know about our action - BUY_CAKE
  {
  type: BUY_CAKE
  }

## Third principle:

- To specify the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure Reducers.
- Reducer - (previousState, action) => newState
- Cake shop -->
  Reducer is the shopkeeper:

  const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
  case BUY_CAKE: return {
  numOfCakes: state.numOfCakes - 1
  }
  }
  }
